# Global Fishing Watch

This repository will host the Global Fishing Watch client application developed by [vizzuality](http://www.vizzuality.com/)

# Requirements

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# Installation

Start by installing the required nodejs packages using `npm` (already bundled with recent nodejs installations)

```
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file from the provided sample and set the missing values accordingly

Next, start the server by running:

```
node server.js
```

You should be able to access your application at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

# Development

The project includes a set of hooks to automatize boring tasks as well as ensure code quality.
To use them, simply enable to built-in git hook manager:

```
./bin/git/init-hooks
```

You only need to do this once. If new hooks/changes to existing hooks are brought from upstream, the git hook manager
 will automatically use them without requiring further actions from you.

Note that as of now, before we fix all errors on the existing codebase, the push will carry on even with errors.

# Production

To compile the project to production environment, you need set the NODE_ENV variable value to `production` and
execute the following command.
```
npm run build
```

This command generates a `dist` folder with the files needed to run application in a nginx or apache server. Your
server needs to be configured to serve all routers from a static `index.html` file.

### nginx
Example nginx config
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name myserver;

    location / {
        root    /labs/Projects/Nodebook/public;
        index   index.html;
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }

}
```

### apache
Example apache configure
```
Options +FollowSymLinks
IndexIgnore */*
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule (.*) index.html
```
